## To Install

#. Download this directory, or clone or fork this repo
#. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

**Note** The `--legacy-peer-deps` is very important since this project uses [React Infinite Scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller), which doesn't (yet) support React 17.
